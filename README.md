# Fremen-Corp---Code-example
Repository created in order to host some Python code.

In order to see how this code works, please execute 301dannon.
You need to give in argument a file (Two example files are provided : nbr and nbr2).

The prototype of the project is :

./301dannon FILE
FILE : A file containing the data.

This project sorts the number contained in the FILE file, with 5 different methods. It then displays how many comparisons were needed for each method, and finally displays the numbers, in the increasing order.
